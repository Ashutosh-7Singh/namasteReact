there are two type of exports
1.normal export
2.named export

see in one file we have only one default export so  basically when we have multiple component or multiple things we have to use name export so we can just add export in the front of the name like 
ex->
export const LOGO_URL

# now also import are of two type 
* 1 -> if we use export default then 
- then just -> import resObje from "path"
* 2 if we do name export then 
- then import comes in example import   {comport} from "path"
